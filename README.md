Transmission_client
===================

This is the altered Transmission settings.json file I use on my Pogoplug computer to handle automatic torrent enqueueing. This means I can add the torrent file to a specified folder location on my Plug computer (I ssh into it from any location) and my Pogoplug, which has the transmission daemon running on it will enqueue the torrent file and start the download onto one of the attached drives. When you have transmission running on a network attached computer, you can access the transmission URL only from the network, the computer is on. With this setting you can however get transmission to do the work for you, from another network.
